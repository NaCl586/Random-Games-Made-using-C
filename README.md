# Random Games Made using C
 Iya tau, saya stress
 
 The games were made when I was in my freshmen year of college.

Games:

2048 - Classic 2048 game with simple interface and using hexadecimal numbers instead of power of two, made mainly for stress relief

Fossil Hunter - Battleship/splash kaboom type game, where coordinates are entered using commands

Monopoly Clone - A clone of monopoly/let's get rich game, which can be played multiplayer (taking turns)

Maze Chase - A simple pac-man/dungeon escape game, where the main focus is the implementation of Breadth First Search for shortest path
